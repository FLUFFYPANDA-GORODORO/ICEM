            The Shree Chanakya Education Society (SCES) was established in
            February 1994, under the visionary leadership of Dr. Tarita Shankar,
            with the aim of providing top quality post-graduate education in the
            Ô¨Åelds of Business Management, International Business and Information
            Technology. By consistently providing quality education over the
            past few decades, institutes at Indira Group is now considered as
            one of the best institutes in Pune.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            At a time when India was struggling to put its economy back on its
            feet, after the nation having pawned the ‚Äúfamily jewels‚Äù just to
            keep aÔ¨Çoat, Dr. Tarita Shankar sensed that education too would have
            to become more broad-based and more vocational in nature if India
            was to stand up to the world competition in quality and price for
            its products. The then Finance Minister had prescribed reforms for
            the economy, and so, in 1994, began a saga of growth and quality in
            education; a story that is just reaching its zenith with 14 full
            Ô¨Çedged Institutes registering a strong presence on Pune‚Äôs
            educational horizon.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Since inception, the Institutes managed by SCES, have maintained
            high academic standards and have successfully provided trained
            manpower to the industrial and services sector of the country. These
            institutes are now listed amongst the top colleges not just in Pune,
            but also in Maharashtra and India.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            With a modest strength of 60 students pursuing a single course, SCES
            has grown steadily and today boasts of 14 Institutes, having more
            than 8000 students from all over India pursuing multi-disciplinary,
            graduate & post-graduate programs.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-10">
            The objective of the institute is providing ‚ÄòManagement education in
            a corporate environment‚Äô, which has been possible due to the sincere
            and dedicated efforts of the members of SCES, who have invaluable
            experience in varied areas like academics, industry, service and
            social-world.
