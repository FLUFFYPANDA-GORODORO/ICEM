            Shree Chanakya Education Society‚Äôs ‚ÄúIndira Group of Institutes‚Äù,
            Pune was established in 1994, with the explicit vision to provide
            sustainable impetus to the corporate and entrepreneurial abilities
            in the youth. The realization that a robust framework of education
            is indispensable for the growth of global leaders, the visionary,
            Dr. Tarita Shankar, Chairperson, Indira Group, integrated her
            pursuit of excellence and articulated educational institutions,
            known as Indira Group of Institutes (IGI), which imbibe human
            excellence and demonstrate strong social values, with a single

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Unrelenting initiatives by the management team at Indira led to
            adding of multi-disciplines such as Management, Information

            Communication to the group and growth has been as deep as it has

            Kindergarten to Doctorate level studies. IGI believes in the
            economic independence of individuals. In this endeavor we aim to
            inspire our post graduate students to create a niche for themselves
            in the Indian Economic order Ô¨Årst, and then compete globally. We owe
            our gratitude to the Indian Industry for consistently collaborating
            with us in this endeavor. Renowned industrialists have visited us
            and tremendously enhanced the morale of our students by sharing
            their vast knowledge and experience about entrepreneurial
            opportunities and foster a spirit of entrepreneurship amongst
            students.
